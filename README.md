👋 Hello, I'm Kahin. I'm a data scientist with experience in MLOps and visualization, currently working at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en).

👀 My primary focus is on designing and implementing ML solutions that solve real-world problems, using cutting-edge technologies and best practices.

🌱 In my spare time, I'm exploring FARM-stack and other similar Full-stack approaches to build a web3 application that leverages the latest advancements in machine learning, blockchain and data analytics.

💞️ I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and collaborate with like-minded individuals, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any ideas or questions.
