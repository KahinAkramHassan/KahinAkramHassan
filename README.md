ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Kahin. I hold a Ph.D. in Abstract Data Visualization from LinkÃ¶ping University. With a strong foundation in data analytics, programming, and business intelligence (BI), I specialize in translating complex data sets into actionable insights through user-centric design and advanced analytics. But let's be honest, in the end, it doesn't matterâ€”the end-user will be like "can I get that in a table?".

âœ¨ My work bridges the gap between theory and practice, integrating academic excellence with practical application. I am passionate about designing and implementing BI solutions that address real-world challenges using cutting-edge technologies and best practices.
