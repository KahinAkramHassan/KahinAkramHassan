- 👋 Hi, I’m Kahin
- 👀 I’m a Data Analyst consulting @ Scania Group. Working on data from their new electrical units. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working, on the side, on two ML projects, and learning how to setup my portfolio on a ubuntu server running on my Raspberry Pi using docker and Ansible, etc. 
- 💞️ I’m always interested in doing new things, so drop a message if you have any questions.
